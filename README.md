# ItemSearch â€“ Machine Filtering Interface

This project provides a simple HTML and CSS interface for filtering industrial machines based on selected attributes. The layout is designed with a left-hand filter menu and a right-hand results area that will eventually display matching machines.

## Purpose

The goal is to create a fast, lightweight filtering system for customers to easily find compatible machines based on criteria such as:

- Material (e.g., Steel, Aluminum, Copper)
- Bend Type (e.g., Tube, Pipe, Profile)
- Capacity (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)

This project serves as the front-end foundation for a more dynamic tool that will later integrate machine data and search functionality.

## Features

- Clean two-column layout using Flexbox
- Simple form for selecting filter criteria
- Placeholder results area to show matching machines
- Modular structure ready for expansion

## Next Steps

- Define filterable machine attributes with stakeholders
- Load sample machine data from a text or JSON file
- Add JavaScript to handle search logic and result rendering
- Optional future integration with a database or API

## Project Status

Initial layout and styling are complete. Awaiting machine data structure to begin functional development.
